# Public images

Do only place images in this directory if it really needs to be exposed publicly
somewhere else on the web.

For instance, the images in the [`corpo/`](./corpo) directory, such as
the [`corpo/logo-email-signature.png`](./corpo/logo-email-signature.png) are
used for emails signatures and must be kept at this exact path.
